Usage: java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar <flags>
The flags and the example commands that use them are listed below. 

(Don't forget to go to https://github.com/pixer415/State-Royale/tree/main/StateRoyale, 
 download one of the .zip files, and place it in the same directory as the jar 
 if you haven't! That's your input.zip, at least until you've created an output.zip.)

(output.zip is the save file that will be generated, saving your progress on the current battle royale; 
 it can also be used as an input.zip once it is created.)

(video.mp4 is the entertainment simulation video that will be generated based on the 
 regional eliminations selected. Examples of the content seen in these videos are shown in EXAMPLES.md.)

(An "ffmpeg_output_msg.txt" file will also be created next to the .jar. This is the console output of ffmpeg.)

Flags:
-rm: Eliminates either: 
     - a set number of remaining regions, chosen randomly
     - regions specified by name in a randomized order 
     - regions specified by name in the order presented (use rm!)
     - all of the remaining regions in a save file

     Examples:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip output.zip video.mp4 -rm <integer arg>
     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip output.zip video.mp4 -rm <region1> <region2> <and> <so> <on>
     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip output.zip video.mp4 -rm! <region1> <region2> <and> <so> <on>
          // must be invoked after the input, output, and video files, in that order

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip -rm video.mp4 
          // must be invoked before the video file

-pl: Similar to -rm!, but uses the "pedastal" animation for video.mp4 instead of the default 
     "slot machine" one. Ideal for poll results. 

     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip output.zip video.mp4 -pl <region1> <region2>
          // must be invoked after the input, output, and video files, in that order

-ls: Creates a .txt containing a comma-separated list of regions remaining in a .zip file. 

     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip -ls list.txt
          // must be invoked before the text file

-oo: Overrides any overwrite prompts, and overwrites any conflicting files. 

     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip -ls list.txt -oo
          // must be invoked at the very end of the command

-no: Overrides any overwrite prompts, and does NOT overwrite any conflicting files. 

     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip -ls list.txt -no 
          // must be invoked at the very end of the command

-[x]x[y]: Overrides the default video resolution of 720x720 for -rm and -pl. 

     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar input.zip -rm video.mp4 -1920x1080
          // must be invoked at the very end of the command; must be invoked after -oo or -no if they are used.

-help: Displays this CLI usage guide. This guide also appears when no args are present. 
 
     Example:

     java -jar State-Royale-[version].jar -help
          // must be invoked as the only arg in the command
